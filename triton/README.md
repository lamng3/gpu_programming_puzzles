## 3. The Core Concept: SPMD

The single **most important** concept in GPU programming is **SPMD** (Single Program, Multiple Data).

> **Definition:** You write **one** program (kernel), and the GPU launches thousands of instances of that program simultaneously, each processing different data.

### ⚡ Triton Boilerplate Example

In Triton, we handle this parallelism by calculating offsets based on the Program ID (`pid`).

```python
# 1. Get the unique ID for this specific program instance
pid = tl.program_id(0)

# 2. Skip ahead to find this instance's specific chunk of data
block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE

# 3. Create a vector of indices to grab specific items
offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
```

**Breakdown:**

* `tl.program_id(axis)`: Returns the ID of the current program instance (similar to a block index).
* `offsets`: The list of indices telling this kernel instance exactly which data to touch.

## 4. Memory Paradigm: Load & Store

Consider adding two 1D vectors `a` and `b`. In standard CPU Python, we iterate sequentially:

```python
# CPU approach (Sequential)
c = [0] * n
for i in range(n):
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
```

On a GPU, we want to process this in parallel (“GPU go brrr”).
However, performance is dominated not by compute, but by **memory hierarchy**.

### HBM vs. SRAM

We can simplify the GPU into two major components:

| Component | Type                    | Characteristics                    | Role in Optimization |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **HBM**   | High Bandwidth Memory   | Huge capacity, high latency (slow) | Main storage         |
| **SRAM**  | Shared / On-chip Memory | Tiny capacity, very low latency    | Scratchpad / cache   |

**The Golden Rule of Triton & FlashAttention:**

> Load data from **HBM** → do as much math as possible in **SRAM** → store back to **HBM**

Minimizing trips to HBM is how you achieve peak performance.

## 5. The Paradigm Shift: Scalar vs. Blocked

### History Lesson 📜

There is a fundamental difference between CUDA and Triton:

| Feature     | **CUDA Model**                  | **Triton Model**                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Granularity | Scalar Program, Blocked Threads | Blocked Program, Scalar Threads |
| Focus       | Managing threads                | Managing blocks of data         |

### Why the change?

A seminal 1991 paper by [M. Lam et al.](https://suif.stanford.edu/papers/lam-asplos91.pdf) established the foundation behind Triton:

> *Programming paradigms based on **blocked algorithms** can facilitate the construction of high-performance compute kernels.*

**Key advantages of blocked algorithms:**

1. **Data locality** — keeps data in fast SRAM
2. **Compiler optimization** — enables aggressive fusion
3. **Sparsity handling** — skip unnecessary work at the block level
